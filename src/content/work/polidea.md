At Polidea, I spent over 4 years in progressive leadership roles. As Head of Engineering (2014-2015), I led the engineering department, overseeing technical teams and ensuring the delivery of high-quality software solutions. I was responsible for technical leadership, team management, and implementing best practices across projects, with a focus on strategic planning, resource allocation, and maintaining technical excellence.

Previously, as Technical Lead (2011-2014), I was responsible for backend development, technology evaluation, and knowledge transfer. I provided technical guidance to development teams, evaluated new technologies for potential adoption, and facilitated knowledge sharing across the organization to enhance technical capabilities and ensure consistent quality in software delivery.
