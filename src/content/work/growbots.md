As CTO at Growbots, I was responsible for the entire IT department of an "AI for Sales" product startup during a dynamic growth period (from 30 to 70 people). I managed a technology stack that included Microservices, Python 2/3, ES6 & React.js, ElasticSearch, MySQL & PostgreSQL, Docker, Nomad, and Google Cloud Engine. Key achievements included growing the Dev Team from 10 to 35 in 8 months, introducing Lean and Kanban methodologies, reducing team rotation from 20-30% per quarter to 0% over three quarters, transitioning the main product from an unstable initial version to one that was stable and robust, coaching individuals to become team leaders, and creating and executing an effective hiring process.
