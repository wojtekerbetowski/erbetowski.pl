As a Community Leader for the Warsaw Java User Group, I organized and facilitated meetups, workshops, and events for Java developers in Warsaw. I was responsible for building and nurturing the local Java community, securing speakers for events, coordinating logistics, and creating valuable networking opportunities for members. This role allowed me to contribute to the growth of the tech community while staying at the forefront of Java technology trends.
