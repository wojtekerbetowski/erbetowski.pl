During my 3+ years at Codility, I progressed through several leadership roles, culminating as Chief Technology Officer. As CTO, I was responsible for the company's technical vision and its execution, building and aligning the development, infrastructure, and security teams, contributing to product vision, setting security strategy and ISO 27001 compliance, managing technical debt, mentoring staff, and managing technology budgets. 

I also served as Principal Software Engineer, taking a proactive role in product development, system maintenance, and software craftsmanship. I helped maintain high code quality through design contributions, code reviews, and pair programming while providing technical customer support and mentoring team members.

Initially joining as Expert Software Engineer, I developed the core product using Python 3.5 & Django on the backend, ES6 with React.js on the frontend, and Java 8 with Cucumber for acceptance tests. I led a product team of 6-8 members using Kanban methodology, focusing on skills testing.
