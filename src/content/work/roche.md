At Roche, I worked with legacy systems that were over 10 years old, adding tests and refactoring code while maintaining ongoing development. I utilized a wide spectrum of technologies including EJB 2.1, Struts and Scout, JDBC, Oracle, Struts 2, Spring, and Wicket. This experience enhanced my ability to work with and modernize legacy systems while ensuring continuous functionality.
