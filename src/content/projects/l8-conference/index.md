# L8 Conference

L8 Conference is a unique, community-driven event that focuses on leadership in software engineering. Inspired by the unofficial '8th layer' of computer networks - the human element - L8 Conf aims to help software engineers enhance their leadership and soft skills.

## About L8

The name "L8" is inspired by the unofficial 8th layer of computer networks - the human element. While the traditional OSI model has 7 layers, the 8th layer represents the people who build and maintain these systems. L8 Conference focuses on developing this crucial layer by helping software engineers enhance their leadership and soft skills.

## What Makes L8 Special

L8 is specifically designed for software engineers who want to develop further in their careers, especially those looking to grow beyond the senior level. The conference brings together world-class speakers to share knowledge and experiences on topics that should be close to each staff engineer's heart.
